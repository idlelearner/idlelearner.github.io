I work as an senior software engineer at Algorithmia in Seattle. I am passionate about coding, enjoy designing systems and building stellar teams. I like to learn a lot and try out new things. This will be a journal where I am planning to write them down so it can be useful for someone. I also travel and have visited 21 US states in last 4 years.
